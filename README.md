# README.md for Homework 4

I created the frontend of a basic blogging app that allows the user to edit posts, and for each post to put in a title, content, and tags. The posts show up on a homepage and the user can navigate to each post to show the whole thing and to edit it. All changes get pushed to a remote state (backend), and the state is received from this backend as well.

I didn't have time to style it as much as I would have liked, so it looks bad, but at least the funcitonality is there. The hardest part was connecting the remote with the local state for sure and making sure components rendered as expected.
